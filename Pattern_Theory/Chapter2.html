<body>


In this chapter, you will need the following:<br>


<br>


- <span style="font-weight: bold;">In Exercise 5:</span><br>
&nbsp;You have to find the individual notes in a simple
piece of music. You can find here some music in the file <a href="cadenza.au">cadenza.au</a>, or just five seconds of it in the file <a href="fivesec.au">fivesec.au</a>. Both are in
a compact format readable by MatLab via 'auread'. <br>


<br>


- <span style="font-weight: bold;">In Exercise 8:</span><br>
&nbsp;You need images to segment 1D slices. Here is an example of <a href="img_r.jpg">a range image</a>. You can find more range images on the Brown Range Image Database: <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/ptg/brid/range/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.dam.brown.edu/ptg/brid/range/index.html</a> . Such images have very clear discontinuities at
the edges of objects.
