In this chapter, you will need the following:<br>

&nbsp;A guessing game. Here is a Matlab code <a href="blur.m">to
blur and
present</a> your favorite image. If you don't have one: try <a href="InkaAlligator.jpg">this one</a>!<br>

On Image compression: if you use the tables of differential entropies of the DCT
coefficients of 8x8 blocks (from Van Hateren's database) -- which can be found here in
<a href="Huangthesis.pdf">Jinggang Huang's thesis</a> (together with many other nice data analysis results) -- as well as his estimate of 1-pixel entropy, then one
finds a savings of about 2 bits per pixel using jpeg's 8x8 DCTs.<br>

We propose <a href="Mandelbrot.m">here</a> some
MatLab code to create some Mandelbrot&rsquo;s
fractal landscapes.<br>
