Some hints about the additional Quiz 1 practice.  Note: these are not complete
solutions.

1. (a)-(d) are in the lecture notes.
(e) Chi-square on n-k-1 df
(f) Chi-square on k df, since
(H-J/n) is symmetric and idempotent with trace k+1-1=k. 
(g) You need to show that (I-H)(H-J/n) = 0.  It is
no longer true when one of the coefficients is nonzero;  in
that case SSR will tend to be larger, so the F ratio will
tend to be larger.

2. (a) Use 1.(a) and y=Xb+eps
(b) in the lecture notes
(c) V(Hy) = HV(y)H.  Use 
idempotence of H to finish.

3. This should be straightforward.

4. (a) X consists of the columns under X1, X2 and X3  (it is 
a 6 x 3 matrix)

(b) yhat = x1 + .5 x2 + .5 x3
error variance estimate = 3.536^2

(c) .5 +- 3.18(1.768) 

(d) 0 +- 3.536(3.18)
