readme_constituent_data: BdM2S2

The files in this zip file are either the raw data used to create our
main data file, or additional files that several of the batch files
call.

They should all be placed in a directory called
"c:\bdm2s2\data\may2002\datasets\". The batch files will then call
them at the appropriate time.
