Introduction to Statistics
--------------------------

These notes intend to provide the Python basics that most undergrad and grad students need for the analysis of their
data. No derivations of formulas are presented, and only the absolutely necessary background. Instead, hands-on
demonstrations of how to impelement the analysis in Python are given.

In addition to the sourcecode here on github, these notes are available 
- in a compiled form ( http://work.thaslwanter.at/Stats/html/ )
- as PDF ( http://work.thaslwanter.at/Stats/StatsIntro.pdf )

Python rocks - also for statistical tasks!
