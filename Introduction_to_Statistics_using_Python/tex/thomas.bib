  abstract = {The purpose of this evidence-based analysis is to determine the effectiveness
	and cost of CIMT for persons with arm dysfunction after a stroke.CONDITION
	AND TARGET POPULATION A stroke is a sudden loss of brain function
	caused by the interruption of blood flow to the brain (ischemic stroke)
	or the rupture of blood vessels in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).
	A stroke can affect any number of areas including the ability to
	move, see, remember, speak, reason, and read and write. Stroke is
	the leading cause of adult neurological disability in Canada; 300,000
	people or 1\% of the population live with its effects. Up to 85\%
	of persons experiencing a complete stroke have residual arm dysfunction
	which will interfere with their ability to live independently. Rehabilitation
	interventions are the cornerstone of care and recovery after a stroke.
	CONSTRAINT-INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY: Constraint-Induced Movement
	(CIMT) is a behavioural approach to neurorehabilitation based on
	the principle of 'learned non-use'. The term is derived from studies
	in nonhuman primates in which somatosensory deafferentation of a
	single forelimb was performed and after which the animal then failed
	to use that limb. This failure to use the limb was deemed 'learned
	non-use'. The major components of CIMT include: i) intense repetitive
	task-oriented training of the impaired limb ii) immobilization of
	the unimpaired arm, and iii) shaping. With regard to the first component,
	persons may train the affected arm for several hours a day for up
	to 10-15 consecutive days. With immobilization, the unaffected arm
	may be restrained for up to 90\% of waking hours. And finally, with
	shaping, the difficulty of the training tasks is progressively increased
	as performance improves and encouraging feedback is provided immediately
	when small gains are achieved.What is the effectiveness and cost
	of CIMT compared with physiotherapy and/or occupational therapy rehabilitative
	care for the treatment of arm dysfunction after stroke in persons
	18 years of age and older?A literature search was performed on January
	21, 2011 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed
	Citations, OVID EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
	Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane Library, Centre for
	Reviews and Dissemination. (Appendix 1) A preliminary search completed
	in August 2010 found a Cochrane Systematic review published in 2009.
	As a result, the literature search for this evidence-based analysis
	was designed to include studies published from January 1, 2008 to
	January 21, 2011.Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials

	difference was found in our primary outcome of arm motor function
	measured with the Action Research Arm Test in favour of CIMT compared
	with usual care delivered with the same intensity and duration. Significant
	differences were also found in three of the five secondary outcome
	measures including Arm Motor Impairment and Perceived Motor Function
	Amount of Use and Quality of Use. There was a nonsignificant effect
	found with the FIM score and the quality of life Stroke Impact Scale
	outcome measure. The nonsignificant effect found with the scale score
	and the quality of life score may be a factor of a nonresponsive
	outcome measure (FIM scale) and/or a type II statistical error from
	an inadequate sample size. The quality of evidence was moderate for
	arm motor function and low for all other outcome measures except
	quality of life, which was very low. Table 1:Summary of Results(*)OutcomeOutcome

  year = {1998},
  volume = {121 ( Pt 8)},
  pages = {1497--1505},
  month = {Aug},
  abstract = {Horizontal and vertical smooth pursuit was compared with otolith-ocular
	responses in 11 patients with cerebellar ataxia and 21 normal subjects
	using three-dimensional magnetic search coil eye movement recordings.
	Otolith-ocular responses were investigated during off-vertical axis
	rotation. This stimulus induces nystagmus consisting of the exponentially
	decaying canalicular response, and an eye-velocity modulation and
	offset which arise from the excitation of the otoliths by the gravity
	vector, which lasts as long as the rotation continues. Otolith-ocular
	reflexes are intimately interrelated with visual tracking when real
	targets are viewed during linear motion. The responses of both the
	translational vestibulo-ocular reflex and the pursuit system have
	been shown to be linearly dependent on the inverse of the viewing
	distance, so that a common central pathway for the two systems has
	been suggested, probably travelling through the cerebellum. Thus,
	the aim of the study was to evaluate to what extent these reflexes
	are disturbed in cerebellar disease. The results confirm the earlier
	notion that in normal subjects pursuit performance is better for
	horizontal than for vertical tracking, and that it is better for
	upward than for downward tracking. This pattern is also found in
	patients. In addition, smooth pursuit performance is clearly degraded
	in patients, but the modulation of eye-velocity during off-vertical
	axis rotation is enhanced. Since the amount of this enhancement does
	not correlate with the amount of pursuit impairment, degradation
	of smooth pursuit and pathological enhancement of otolith-ocular
	responses seem to be independent effects of cerebellar degeneration.
	Thus, the increase in the otolith-ocular response in patients cannot
	be attributed to adaptational mechanisms trying to overcome the smooth
	pursuit deficiency; it is more likely to represent pathological disinhibition
	of otolith derived responses. The absence of compensatory eye-velocity
	offset during off-vertical axis rotation may reflect the fact that
	in patients the otolith signals are not utilized in computations
	thought to be important for spatial orientation mechanisms arising
	from the interaction of vestibular, visual and somatosensory signals.},

  abstract = {1. We studied the three-dimensional input-output human vestibuloocular
	reflex (VOR) kinematics after selective loss of semicircular canal
	(SCC) function either through total unilateral vestibular deafferentation
	(uVD) or through single posterior SCC occlusion (uPCO), and showed
	large deficits in magnitude and direction in response to high-acceleration
	head rotations (head "impulses"). 2. A head impulse is a passive,
	unpredictable, high-acceleration (3,000-4,000 degrees/s2) head rotation
	through an amplitude of 10-20 degrees in roll, pitch, or yaw. The
	subjects were tested while seated in the upright position and focusing
	on a fixation target. Head and eye rotations were measured with the
	use of dual search coils, and were expressed as rotation vectors.
	A three-dimensional vector analysis was performed on the input-output
	VOR kinematics after uVD, to produce two indexes in the time domain:
	magnitude and direction. Magnitude is expressed as speed gain (G)
	and direction as misalignment angle (delta). 3. G. after uVD, was
	significantly lower than normal in both directions of head rotation
	during roll, pitch, and yaw impulses, and were much lower during
	ipsilesional than during contralesional roll and yaw impulses. At
	80 ms from the onset of an impulse (i.e., near peak head velocity),
	G was 0.23 +/- 0.08 (SE) (ipsilesional) and 0.56 +/- 0.08 (contralesional)
	for roll impulses, 0.61 +/- 0.09 (up) and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (down) for
	pitch impulses, and 0.36 +/- 0.06 (ipsilesional) and 0.76 +/- 0.09
	(contralesional) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals).
	4. delta, after uVD, was significantly different from normal during
	ipsilesional roll and yaw impulses and during pitch-up and pitch-down
	impulses. delta was normal during contralesional roll and yaw impulses.
	At 80 ms from the onset of the impulse, delta was 30.6 +/- 4.5 (ipsilesional)
	and 13.4 +/- 5.0 (contralesional) for roll impulses, 23.7 +/- 3.7
	(up) and 31.6 +/- 4.4 (down) for pitch impulses, and 68.7 +/- 13.2
	(ipsilesional) and 11.0 +/- 3.3 (contralesional) for yaw impulses
	(mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals). 5. VOR gain (gamma), after
	uVD, were significantly lower than normal for both directions of
	roll, pitch, and yaw impulses and much lower during ipsilesional
	than during contralesional roll and yaw impulses. At 80 ms from the
	onset of the head impulse, the gamma was 0.22 +/- 0.08 (ipsilesional)
	and 0.54 +/- 0.09 (contralesional) for roll impulses, 0.55 +/- 0.09
	(up) and 0.61 +/- 0.09 (down) for pitch impulses, and 0.14 +/- 0.10
	(ipsilesional) and 0.74 +/- 0.06 (contralesional) for yaw impulses
	(mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals). Because gamma is equal to [G*cos
	(delta)], it is significantly different from its corresponding G
	during ipsilesional roll and yaw, and during all pitch impulses,
	but not during contralesional roll and yaw impulses. 6. After uPCO,
	pitch-vertical gamma during pitch-up impulses was reduced to the
	same extent as after uVD; roll-torsional gamma during ipsilesional
	roll impulses was significantly lower than normal but significantly
	higher than after uVD. At 80 ms from the onset of the head impulse,
	gamma was 0.32 +/- 0.13 (ipsilesional) and 0.55 +/- 0.16 (contralesional)
	for roll impulses, 0.51 +/- 0.12 (up) and 0.91 +/- 0.14 (down) for
	pitch impulses, and 0.76 +/- 0.06 (ipsilesional) and 0.73 +/- 0.09
	(contralesional) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals).
	7. The eye rotation axis, after uVD, deviates in the yaw plane, away
	from the normal interaural axis, toward the nasooccipital axis, during
	all pitch impulses. After uPCO, the eye rotation axis deviates in
	same direction as after uVD during pitch-up impulses, but is well
	aligned with the head rotation axis during pitch-down impulses.},

  abstract = {Modulation of the caloric nystagmus in response to repositioning the
	plane of one vertical semicircular canal from gravitational horizontal
	to vertical during continuous caloric stimulation was used to measure
	the vertical canal's contribution to the nystagmus. The rationale
	was to examine the thermovective response from one vertical canal
	at a time, after a temperature gradient had been established across
	its two limbs. The nystagmus was measured and analysed in three dimensions
	using orthogonal head-referenced coordinates. The magnitude of each
	semicircular canal's contribution to the overall caloric response,
	the canal vector, was determined in non-orthogonal, contravariant
	semicircular canal plane coordinates. By using the canal plane reorientation
	technique and contravariant canal plane coordinates, we were able
	to measure the proportional thermovective response magnitude generated
	by each vertical canal during caloric stimulation. We found that
	the anterior canal contributed about one-third and the posterior
	canal about one-tenth as much as the lateral canal did to the overall
	caloric response magnitude when it was reoriented from horizontal
	to vertical. Comparison of the eye rotation axis before and after

	of the caloric nystagmus by the vertical canal response. When one
	vertical canal plane was horizontal during caloric stimulation, the

	canal and the lateral canal response axes. After vertical canal plane
	reorientation, the eye rotation axis realigned towards the resultant

  abstract = {1. The kinematics of the human angular vestibuloocular reflex (VOR)
	in three dimensions was investigated in 12 normal subjects during
	high-acceleration head rotations (head "impulses"). A head impulse
	is a passive, unpredictable, high-acceleration (3,000-4,000 degrees/s2)
	head rotation of approximately 10-20 degrees in roll, pitch, or yaw,
	delivered with the subject in the upright position and focusing on
	a fixation target. Head and eye rotations were measured with dual
	search coils and expressed as rotation vectors. The first of these
	two papers describes a vector analysis of the three-dimensional input-output
	kinematics of the VOR as two indexes in the time domain: magnitude
	and direction. 2. Magnitude is expressed as speed gain (G) and direction
	as misalignment angle (delta). G is defined as the ratio of eye velocity
	magnitude (eye speed) to head velocity magnitude (head speed). delta
	is defined as the instantaneous angle by which the eye rotation axis
	deviates from perfect alignment with the head rotation axis in three
	dimensions. When the eye rotation axis aligns perfectly with the
	head rotation axis and when eye velocity is in a direction opposite
	to head velocity, delta = 0. The orientation of misalignment between
	the head and the eye rotation axes is characterized by two spatial
	misalignment angles, which are the projections of delta onto two
	orthogonal coordinate planes that intersect at the head rotation
	axis. 3. Time series of G were calculated for head impulses in roll,
	pitch, and yaw. At 80 ms after the onset of an impulse (i.e., near
	peak head velocity), values of G were 0.72 +/- 0.07 (counterclockwise)
	and 0.75 +/- 0.07 (clockwise) for roll impulses, 0.97 +/- 0.05 (up)
	and 1.10 +/- 0.09 (down) for pitch impulses, and 0.95 +/- 0.06 (right)
	and 1.01 +/- 0.07 (left) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence
	intervals). 4. The eye rotation axis was well aligned with head rotation
	axis during roll, pitch, and yaw impulses: delta remained almost
	constant at approximately 5-10 degrees, so that the spatial misalignment
	angles were < or = 5 degrees. delta was 9.6 +/- 3.1 (counterclockwise)
	and 9.0 +/- 2.6 (clockwise) for roll impulses, 5.7 +/- 1.6 (up) and
	6.1 +/- 1.9 (down) for pitch impulses, and 6.2 +/- 2.2 (right) and
	7.9 +/- 1.5 (left) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals).
	5. VOR gain (gamma) is the product of G and cos(delta). Because delta
	is small in normal subjects, gamma is not significantly different
	from G. At 80 ms after the onset of an impulse, gamma was 0.70 +/-
	0.08 (counterclockwise) and 0.74 +/- 0.07 (clockwise) for roll impulses,
	0.97 +/- 0.05 (up) and 1.09 +/- 0.09 (down) for pitch impulses, and
	0.94 +/- 0.06 (right) and 1.00 +/- 0.07 (left) for yaw impulses (mean
	+/- 95\% confidence intervals). 6. VOR latencies, estimated with
	a latency shift method, were 10.3 +/- 1.9 (SD) ms for roll impulses,
	7.6 +/- 2.8 (SD) ms for pitch impulses, and 7.5 +/- 2.9 (SD) ms for
	yaw impulses. 7. We conclude that the normal VOR produces eye rotations
	that are almost perfectly compensatory in direction as well as in
	speed, but only during yaw and pitch impulses. During roll impulses,
	eye rotations are well aligned in direction, but are approximately
	30\% slower in speed.},

  abstract = {Reaching for an object while simultaneously rotating induces Coriolis
	and centrifugal inertial forces on the arm that require compensatory
	actions to maintain accuracy. We investigated whether the nervous
	system uses vestibular signals of head rotation to predict inertial
	forces. Human subjects reached in darkness to a remembered target
	33 cm distant. Subjects were stationary, but experienced a strong
	vestibular rotation signal. We achieved this by rotating subjects
	at 360 degrees /s in yaw for 2 min and then stopping, and subjects
	reached during the 'post-rotary' period when the deceleration is
	interpreted by the vestibular system as a rotation in the opposite
	direction. Arm trajectories were straight in control trials without
	a rotary stimulus. With vestibular stimulation, trajectory curvature
	increased an average of 3 cm in the direction of the vestibular stimulation
	(e.g., to the right for a rightward yaw stimulus). Vestibular-induced
	curvature returned rapidly to normal, with an average time constant
	of 6 s. Movements also became longer as the vestibular stimulus diminished,
	and returned towards normal length with an average time constant
	of 5.6 s. In a second experiment we compared reaching with preferred
	and non-preferred hands, and found that they were similarly affected
	by vestibular stimulation. The reach curvatures were in the expected
	direction if the nervous system anticipated and attempted to counteract
	the presence of Coriolis forces based on the vestibular signals.
	Similarly, the shorter reaches may have occurred because the nervous
	system was attempting to compensate for an expected centrifugal force.
	Since vestibular stimulation also alters the perceived location of
	targets, vestibular signals probably influence all stages of the
	sensorimotor pathway transforming the desired goal of a reach into
	specific motor-unit innervation.},

	Similar to findings in monkeys, the eyes counterrolled during roll

	a maximum torsion of 4.9 degrees. Counterroll was not proportional
	to the shear force on the macula of the utricles: gain (torsion/sine

	down. During pitch forward, torsion increased when subjects looked

  abstract = {We describe in detail the frequency response of the human three-dimensional
	angular vestibulo-ocular response (3-D aVOR) over a frequency range
	of 0.05-1 Hz. Gain and phase of the human aVOR were determined for
	passive head rotations in the dark, with the rotation axis either
	aligned with or perpendicular to the direction of gravity (earth-vertical
	or earth-horizontal). In the latter case, the oscillations dynamically
	stimulated both the otolith organs and the semi-circular canals.
	We conducted experiments in pitch and yaw, and compared the results
	with previously-published roll data. Regardless of the axis of rotation
	and the orientation of the subject, the gain in aVOR increased with
	frequency to about 0.3 Hz, and was approximately constant from 0.3
	to 1 Hz. The aVOR gain during pitch and yaw rotations was larger
	than during roll rotations. Otolith and canal cues combined differently
	depending upon the axis of rotation: for torsional and pitch rotations,
	aVOR gain was higher with otolith input; for yaw rotations the aVOR
	was not affected by otolith stimulation. There was a phase lead in
	all three dimensions for frequencies below 0.3 Hz when only the canals
	were stimulated. For roll and pitch rotations this phase lead vanished
	with dynamic otolith stimulation. In contrast, the horizontal phase
	showed no improvement with additional otolith input during yaw rotations.
	The lack of a significant otolith contribution to the yaw aVOR was
	observed when subjects were supine, prone or lying on their sides.
	Our results confirm studies with less-natural stimuli (off-vertical
	axis rotation) that the otoliths contribute a head-rotation signal
	to the aVOR. However, the magnitude of the contribution depends on
	the axis of rotation, with the gain in otolith-canal cross-coupling
	being smallest for yaw axis rotations. This could be because, in
	humans, typical yaw head movements will stimulate the otoliths to
	a much lesser extent then typical pitch and roll head movements.},

  abstract = {The semi-circular canals and the otolith organs both contribute to
	gaze stabilization during head movement. We investigated how these
	sensory signals interact when they provide conflicting information
	about head orientation in space. Human subjects were reoriented 90
	degrees in pitch or roll during long-duration, constant-velocity
	rotation about the earth-vertical axis while we measured three-dimensional
	eye movements. After the reorientation, the otoliths correctly indicated
	the static orientation of the subject with respect to gravity, while
	the semicircular canals provided a strong signal of rotation. This
	rotation signal from the canals could only be consistent with a static
	orientation with respect to gravity if the rotation-axis indicated
	by the canals was exactly parallel to gravity. This was not true,
	so a cue-conflict existed. These conflicting stimuli elicited motion
	sickness and a complex tumbling sensation. Strong horizontal, vertical,
	and/or torsional eye movements were also induced, allowing us to
	study the influence of the conflict between the otoliths and the
	canals on all three eye-movement components. We found a shortening
	of the horizontal and vertical time constants of the decay of nystagmus
	and a trend for an increase in peak velocity following reorientation.
	The dumping of the velocity storage occurred regardless of whether
	eye velocity along that axis was compensatory to the head rotation
	or not. We found a trend for the axis of eye velocity to reorient
	to make the head-velocity signal from the canals consistent with
	the head-orientation signal from the otoliths, but this reorientation
	was small and only observed when subjects were tilted to upright.
	Previous models of canal-otolith interaction could not fully account
	for our data, particularly the decreased time constant of the decay
	of nystagmus. We present a model with a mechanism that reduces the
	velocity-storage component in the presence of a strong cue-conflict.
	Our study, supported by other experiments, also indicates that static
	otolith signals exhibit considerably smaller effects on eye movements
	in humans than in monkeys.},

  abstract = {Dual search coils were used to record horizontal, vertical and torsional
	eye movement components of one eye during nystagmus caused by off-center
	yaw rotation (yaw centrifugation). Both normal healthy human subjects
	(n=7) and patients with only one functioning labyrinth (n=12) were
	studied in order to clarify how the concomitant linear acceleration
	affected the nystagmus response. Each subject was seated with head
	erect on the arm of a fixed-chair human centrifuge, 1 m away from
	the center of the rotation, and positioned to be facing along a radius;
	either towards (facing-in) or away from (facing-out) the center of
	rotation. Both yaw right and yaw left angular accelerations of 10
	degrees s(-2) from 0 to 200 degrees/s were studied. During rotation
	a centripetal linear acceleration (increasing from 0 to 1.24xg units)
	was directed along the subject's naso-occipital axis resulting in
	a shift of the resultant angle of the gravitoinertial acceleration
	(GIA) of 51 degrees in the subject's pitch plane and an increase
	in the total GIA magnitude from 1.0 to 1.59xg. In normal subjects
	during the angular acceleration off-center there were, in addition
	to the horizontal eye velocity components, torsional and vertical
	eye velocities present. The magnitude of these additional components,
	although small, was larger than observed during similar experiments
	with on-center angular acceleration (Haslwanter et al. 1996), and
	the change in these components is attributed to the additional effect
	of the linear acceleration stimulation. In the pitch plane the average
	size of the shift of the axis of eye velocity (AEV) during the acceleration
	was about 8 degrees for a 51 degrees shift of the GIA (around 16\%
	of the GIA shift) so that the AEV-GIA alignment was inadequate. There
	was a very marked difference in the size of the AEV shift depending
	on whether the person was facing-in [AEV shift forward (i.e. non-compensatory)
	of about 4 degrees] or facing-out [AEV shift forward (i.e. compensatory)
	of around 12 degrees]. The linear acceleration decreased the time
	constant of decay of the horizontal component of the post-rotatory
	nystagmus: from an average of 24.8 degrees/s facing-in to an average
	of 11.3 degrees/s facing-out. The linear acceleration dumps torsional
	eye velocity in an manner analogous to, but independent of, the dumping
	of horizontal eye velocity. Patients with UVD had dramatically reduced
	torsional eye velocities for both facing-in and facing-out headings,
	and there was little if any shift of the AEV in UVD patients. The
	relatively small effects of linear acceleration on human canal-induced
	nystagmus found here confirms other recent studies in humans (Fetter
	et al. 1996) in contrast to evidence from monkeys and emphasizes
	the large and important differences between humans and monkeys in
	otolith-canal interaction. Our results confirm the vestibular control
	of the axis of eye velocity of humans is essentially head-referenced
	whereas in monkeys that control is essentially space-referenced.},

	of the eye rotation axis (velocity vector) were calculated in head
	coordinates.In all subjects, in standard caloric position, warm caloric
	produced eye velocity vectors that clustered closely along the direction

	With the recent availability of modern 3D eye movement measurement
	techniques and the further development of appropriate mathematical
	descriptions, we are now able to study eye movements in all three
	degrees of freedom. This article describes the basic mathematical
	tools for 3D eye movement analysis like rotation vectors, reference
	frames, coordinate systems, and the concept of Listing's law. In
	a second part some clinical applications are presented. The close
	coupling between the vestibular and the oculomotor system suggests
	that by observing spontaneous and elicited eye movements in the case
	of an acute unilateral vestibular pathology we might be able to find
	out which parts of the vestibular system (that is, which of the semicircular
	canals or which of the otoliths) are affected. The rationale of such
	an analysis is based on the observation that electrical stimulation
	of single semicircular canal afferents in animals induces eye movements
	that lie roughly in the plane of the canal. It is, therefore, possible
	to deduce which canals cause the eye movements observed when only
	some parts of the vestibular system are defective. Thus, the analysis
	of 3D movements not only provides an improved understanding of how
	the brain organizes movement in 3D space, but also has the potential

	also causes a vertical velocity offset (in all subjects, slow phase

	components with the frequency of the rotation. The maximum steady-state
	response in the horizontal constant-velocity component was much smaller

  abstract = {We recorded three-dimensional eye and head movements during circular,
	horizontal, vertical, and torsional head shaking in six human subjects
	with normal vestibular function. With circular head shaking, the
	stimulation of the canals by the termination of the head movement
	is similar to that following a step in velocity about the naso-occipital
	axis. A large torsional nystagmus with slow phase eye velocity of
	about 20 degrees/s was observed upon cessation of circular head shaking.
	The three-dimensional eye movements expected from stimulation of
	the semicircular canals by the head-shaking maneuvers were calculated.
	The predicted activation of the canals was determined by projecting
	the head velocity (in head coordinates) into the canal planes and
	then processing the signal with the transfer function of the canals.
	The torsional eye velocity components predicted by the stimulation
	of the canals matched the recorded ones. We observed small horizontal
	eye velocities that could not be predicted by the stimulation of
	the canals alone. No eye movements were observed after the end of
	head shaking about a fixed horizontal or vertical axis. The eye velocities
	following the termination of head oscillations in the roll plane
	were small. The analysis methods developed for this study may be
	useful in the investigation of eye movements elicited by other types

  abstract = {The perception of body position is mainly mediated by otolith information
	and visual cues. It has been shown, however, that proprioceptive
	sources are also involved. To distinguish between the contributions
	of the vestibular and nonvisual extra-vestibular information to graviception,
	we tested the effects of a stimulus that leaves the vestibular input
	unchanged but modifies the information from sense organs located
	more caudal along the trunk. This was achieved by bringing subjects
	into a horizontal ear-down position and rotating them around an earth-vertical
	axis that coincided with the interaural axis. In this paradigm, through
	centrifugal force, the stimulation of the vestibular and the putative
	extravestibular graviceptive organs in the body becomes dissociated.
	Healthy subjects (n = 14) and paraplegic patients with lesions between
	T4 and T8 (n = 7) adjusted themselves to the perceived horizontal
	right-ear down body position under two conditions: one with constant
	velocity rotation (ROT, velocity =120 degrees /s) around the earth-vertical
	axis of the turntable, and one without rotation (BASE). Among healthy
	subjects, the individual differences between BASE and ROT varied
	widely in both the feet-up or feet-down direction. In contrast, adjustments
	in paraplegic patients during ROT were always in the feet-down direction
	compared with BASE. A model with two extravestibular graviceptive
	sensors could explain our results: one sensor is located rostral
	to T4, and the other is caudal to T8. A load on the rostral graviceptor
	is interpreted as a tilt of the body in the feet-up direction and
	shifts the adjustments of perceived body position feet-down; a load
	on the caudal receptor is interpreted as a tilt in the feet-down
	direction and shifts the perceived body position feet-up. During

	with convergence of the eyes causing torsion, which is dependent
	on eye elevation. The amount by which the planes rotate differs from
	study to study. To gain insight into the functional significance
	of the temporal tilt of Listing's plane for vision, we examined whether
	the rotation of the plane depends on the visual conditions, namely
	on the stimuli driving vergence. In different conditions, accommodative
	vergence, disparity-vergence, combinations of disparity with accommodation
	or depth perception were used and the resulting rotation of Listing's
	plane was measured. Our findings show, for the first time, that the
	relationship between convergence and Listing's-plane temporal rotation
	depends on the stimuli driving vergence. When the stimulus contains
	only disparity cues, vergence and Listing's plane rotate immediately
	and consistently among subjects. Accommodative vergence, the mutual
	couplings between vergence and accommodation, can influence the orientation
	of Listing's plane, but they do so in a idiosyncratic way. The largest
	rotation was elicited by stereograms combining disparity-vergence
	with depth perception. These findings support the idea of a functional
	role of Listing's plane rotation for binocular vision, perhaps for
	depth perception.},

	to the center of the visual field, but torsional movements rotate
	the visual world about its center. Ocular torsion stays near zero
	during head-fixed gaze shifts, and eye movements to visual targets
	are thought to be driven by purely horizontal and vertical commands.
	Here, analysis of eye-head gaze shifts revealed that gaze commands
	were three-dimensional, with a separate neural control system for
	torsion. Active torsion optimized gaze control as no two-dimensional
	system could have, stabilizing the retinal image as quickly as possible
	when it would otherwise have spun around the fixation point.},

  abstract = {In non-commutative algebra, order makes a difference to multiplication,
	so that a x b not equal to b x a. This feature is necessary for computing
	rotary motion, because order makes a difference to the combined effect
	of two rotations. It has therefore been proposed that there are non-commutative
	operators in the brain circuits that deal with rotations, including
	motor circuits that steer the eyes, head and limbs, and sensory circuits
	that handle spatial information. This idea is controversial: studies
	of eye and head control have revealed behaviours that are consistent
	with non-commutativity in the brain, but none that clearly rules
	out all commutative models. Here we demonstrate non-commutative computation
	in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. We show that subjects rotated in
	darkness can hold their gaze points stable in space, correctly computing
	different final eye-position commands when put through the same two
	rotations in different orders, in a way that is unattainable by any
	commutative system.},

	trochlear nerve palsy (uTNP) by the kinematics of three-dimensional
	eye rotations.Twelve patients with uTNP monocularly fixed on targets
	on a Hess screen were oscillated (+/- 35 degrees, 0.3 Hz) about the
	roll axis on a motorized turntable (dynamic BHT). Three-dimensional
	eye movements were recorded with dual search coils. Normal data were
	collected from 11 healthy subjects.The rotation axis of the viewing
	paretic or unaffected eye was nearly parallel to the line of sight.
	The rotation axis of the covered fellow eye, however, was tilted
	inward relative to the other axis. This convergence of axes increased
	with gaze toward the unaffected side. Over entire cycles of head
	roll, the rotation axis of either eye remained relatively stable
	in both the viewing and covered conditions.In patients with uTNP,
	circular gaze trajectories of the covered paretic or unaffected eye
	during dynamic BHT are a direct consequence of the nasal deviation
	of the rotation axis from the line of sight. This, in turn, is a
	geometrical result of decreased force by the superior oblique muscle
	(SO) of the covered paretic eye or, according to Hering's law, increased
	force parallel to the paretic SO in the covered unaffected eye. The
	horizontal incomitance of rotation axes along horizontal eye positions
	can be explained by the same mechanism.},

	vertical angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) on gravity in five
	human subjects. The gain was decreased for 1 h by sinusoidal oscillation
	in pitch about a spatial vertical axis in a subject-stationary surround
	with the head oriented left-side down. Gains were tested by sinusoidal
	oscillation about a spatial vertical axis while subjects were tilted
	in 15 degrees increments from left- to right-side down positions
	through the upright. Changes in gain of the vertical component of
	the induced eye movements were expressed as a percentage of the preadapted
	values for the final analysis. Vertical aVOR gain changes were maximal
	in the position in which the gain had been adapted and declined progressively
	as subjects were moved from this position. Gain changes were plotted
	as a function of head orientation and fit with a sine function. The
	bias level of the fitted sines, i.e., the gravity-independent gain
	change, was -29+/-10\% (SD). The gains varied around this bias as
	a function of head position by +/-18+/-6\%, which were the gravity-dependent
	gain changes. The gravity-dependent gain changes induced by only
	1 h of adaptation persisted, gradually declining over several days.
	We conclude that there is a component of the vertical aVOR gain change
	in humans that is dependent on the head orientation in which the
	gain was adapted, and that this dependence can persist for substantial
	periods.},
