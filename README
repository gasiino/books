This is a fork from burakbayramli/books in case that repository is cleared in the future. 
I was looking for data related to the book Introductory Time series with R by Copertwait & Metcalfe 
and could not find their data anywhere online. 
Especially the container ~pscowper and the website massey.ac.nz had not trace of it. 
Thanks burakbayramli. 
All the content of this folder is exactly as in the original burakbayramli repository. 
If I look at a book's code I might add changes/fixes to make it runnable.
