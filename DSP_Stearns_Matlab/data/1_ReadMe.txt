1_README.TXT (DATA FOLDER)

Greetings:

This folder contains the 3 data files used in the 
textbook, plus 3 other files.

The 3 binary files (*.bin) are Matlab binary files 
containing an image, a seismic waveform, and a speech 
segment.

The Matlab file, "display_data.m," will display the 
three binary files when you run it in Matlab.  The 
statements in this file are easy to understand. They 
show how to read and display binary data files.
