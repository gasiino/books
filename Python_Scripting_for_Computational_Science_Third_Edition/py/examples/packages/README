This directory contains examples on reorganizing a package.

orig: the original package P with modules A and B
new:  the new package P with a new module New, containing the old A and
      B, and with backward compatibility such that users can access P.A
      and P.B (see __init__.py for how to do this)

new2: as new, but there is a deprecation warning for module A.
