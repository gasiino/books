\begin{titledslide}{The official (and true) learning outcomes}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Apply appropriate techniques from graphical modelling to
    handle uncertainty in real-world situations;
  \item Understand the sources of computational complexity in probabilistic inference;
  \item Understand the basics of Monte Carlo computation;
  \item Write Python programs to implement graphical modelling algorithms 
  \end{itemize}

\end{titledslide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{titledslide}{Time to see a graphical model}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bayesian networks are, by far, the most popular graphical model.
  \item Netica only runs under Windows\\
 \verb|g:\apps\netica\netica 1.12\netica.exe|
  \item A password is required for full functionality.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{titledslide}

\begin{titledslide}{Resources}

\begin{description}
\item[Lecture overheads] You're seeing some. Generally brief.  Some
  slides are just prompts. 
\item[Scripts] The scripts for the demos and animations will be provided.
\item[gPy] This is a collection of Python modules from which all
  scripts import their core functionality.
\item[People] Let's arrange a suitable time for the AGM surgeries now.
\end{description}

\end{titledslide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{titledslide}{Draft text book}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Bayesian Networks and Beyond: Probabilistic Models for
      Reasoning and Learning} by Daphne Koller \& Nir Friedman
  \item I have access to the electronic version. You are only allowed
    hardcopy, purchasable (at cost) from the Departmental Office.
  \item This is a high-quality, very low cost text.
  \item The only catch is that you have to provide feedback!
  \end{itemize}

\end{titledslide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{titledslide}{Another draft text book!}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Algorithms for Graphical Models} by James Cussens
  \item This would be the module textbook, but I have only written the
    first 141 pages.
  \item It should still be of some use to you, so the current version
    is available from the module web page.
  \item It's likely to be updated as the module progresses.
  \end{itemize}

\end{titledslide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{titledslide}{An actually-completed textbook}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Probabilistic Networks and Expert Systems} by Cowell,
    Dawid, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter
  \item Excellent book, now available in paperback at a little under
    \pounds 30.
  \item The library has 2 on ordinary loan, 2 on 1-week loan and one
    on short loan (in the `key texts' section).
  \end{itemize}

\end{titledslide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{titledslide}{Why Python?}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This module focuses on the underlying \emph{algorithms} for graphical
    models.
  \item On the one hand we don't want to clutter the presentation of
    the algorithms, on the other we want to avoid vagueness.
  \item Hence Python: high-level `executable pseudo-code'
  \item Also has easy graphics (Tkinter).
  \end{itemize}

\end{titledslide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{titledslide}{Practicals}

  Answers to exercises will be provided, but exercises will not be
  marked. So it is up to you to
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Do the exercises (in practical sessions and in your own time)
  \item Ensure that you are getting a reasonable number of questions
    correct
  \item Check that you understand the answers to exercises
    \item Seek help (during practicals, during surgeries) if you are
      having problems.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{titledslide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{titledslide}{Module web page}
There is yet more teaching material which you can reach
via the module page\\
 \verb|http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/agm/|

This is where all the online stuff is, including the code.

Lecture overheads are PDF. A good idea to use acroread to print to a
PostScript file and then psnup them
before printing.

\end{titledslide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{titledslide}{Assessment}
  
\begin{itemize}
\item It's open and partly assessed by whether your code passes
  various \emph{unittests} --- extreme assessment!
\item `Clarifications' are conducted entirely by email
\item Submission is electronic
\item Hand out: Wed/8/Autumn
\item Hand in: Wed/2/Spring
\end{itemize}

\end{titledslide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\end{document}

2/week. These define the module. Overheads on-line
\item[Practicals] One 2-hour session per week. Exercises are on the
web. Not all exercises are computer-based.
\item[Software] We will use two packages Netica and BUGS, both of
which come with extensive documentation.
\item[Algorithm library] Collection of examinable BN algorithms (in Python)
\item[Books] \emph{An Introduction to Bayesian Networks} and
\emph{Probabilistic Expert Systems} are both very useful and
unavailable \dots
\item[Weekly surgery] 1215-1315, Mondays, Biology S/111

\begin{titledslide}{(Very) new book}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Bayesian Networks and Beyond: Probabilistic Models for
      Reasoning and Learning} by Daphne Koller \& Nir Friedman
  \item I have access to the electronic version. You are only allowed
    hardcopy, purchasable (at cost) from the Departmental Office.

\begin{titledslide}{Weekly organisation}
 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Lecture schedule is loose, some will run over their official
  time, but others are short to compensate.
\item I have had to reschedule two lectures.
  \item Practicals are compulsory. The first is in Week 3
  \end{itemize}

\begin{titledslide}{Software}

\begin{itemize}
\item Netica only runs under Windows NT \\
  \verb|g:\apps\netica\netica 1.12\netica.exe|
\item BUGS runs under Linux \\
  \verb|/usr/local/bin/bugs|\\
