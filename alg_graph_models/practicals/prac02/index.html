<h4><a id="The_hypergraph"></a>The hypergraph of a factored distribution</h4>
<p>
Start up the python interpreter.
You will be displaying a factored distribution so first create a
      scrolled frame object in which to display it:</p>
<pre>
>>> from Tkinter import Tk
>>> root = Tk()
>>> from gPy.Utils import scrolled_frame
>>> sf = scrolled_frame(root)
</pre>
<p>
We will use the 'Asia' Bayesian network (BN) as our factored
distribution. The factors of a BN are of a special sort: conditional
probability tables (CPTs), but here we want to treat them as normal
factors. This can be effected in gPy by multiplying each by 1. Don't
      forget to indent the line inside the for loop.
    </p>
<pre>
>>> from gPy.Examples import asia
>>> for cpt in asia:
...  cpt *= 1
...
>>>
</pre>
<p>Now take a look at the distribution.</p>
<pre>
>>> asia.gui_display(sf)
</pre>
<p>OK, your first task is write down the hypergraph associated with
      this factored distribution. Recall that a hypergraph is a set of
      hyperedges, and each hyperedge is a set of vertices. Here each
      vertex is the name of a random variable. Once you think you have
      it right, check you have the right
    answer.</p>
<pre>
>>> print asia.hypergraph()
</pre>
<p>Is this hypergraph reduced? Once you have decided check your
      answer.</p>
<pre>
>>> asia.hypergraph().is_reduced()
</pre>
<p>Now work out the reduction (reduced version) of this
      hypergraph. (If it is already reduced then the reduction is the
      same as the original hypegraph.) Check your answer.</p>
<pre>
>>> hg = asia.hypergraph()
>>> hg.red()
>>> print hg
</pre>
<p>
If you want to understand how the red method works do:</p>
<pre>
>>> help(hg.red)
</pre>
<p>Don't kill your Python session, it will save you time to keep it around
    for the next question ...</p>
<hr />

<h4><a id="graphs"></a>Graphs from hypergraphs</h4>
 
<p>I'm assuming you have a Python session with the objects from the
last question. Firstly make a (new) copy of the 'Asia' hypergraph.</p>
<pre>
>>> asia_hg = asia.hypergraph()
</pre>
<p>Since <code>asia_hg</code> is a <em>copy</em> of the hypergraph
associated with 'Asia' we can alter it without altering the
<code>asia</code> object. To reassure yourself that this is the case
look at the documentation for the <code>hypergraph</code> method. (Hit
    'q' to quit the help.)</p>
<pre>
>>> help(asia.hypergraph)
</pre>
<p>Write down the 2-section of the 'Asia' hypergraph. Now check your
answer. If you want to rearrange the graph's vertices in
      the GUI: just move them by dragging with the left mouse button.</p>
<pre>
>>> print asia_hg.two_section()
>>> asia_hg.two_section().gui_display(sf)
</pre>
<p>Now remove a hyperedge from the hypergraph:</p>
<pre>
>>> asia_hg.remove_hyperedge(['Cancer', 'TbOrCa', 'Tuberculosis'])
</pre>
<p>What is the graph of the (altered) hypergraph? Check your answer with:</p>
<pre>
>>> asia_hg.two_section().gui_display(sf)
</pre>

<hr />

<h4><a id="cliques"></a>Hypergraphs from graphs</h4>

<p>First we need a graph. Save the
following 4 lines of Python source to a file <code>stuff.py</code> in
your working directory.</p>
<pre>
from Tkinter import Tk
from gPy.Graphs import UGraph
root = Tk()
gr = UGraph('abcdef')
</pre>
    <p>Restart a new Python session. Grab all the objects defined in
    <code>stuff.py</code> and start up gPy's rudimentary graph
    editor.</p>
<pre>
>>> from stuff import *
>>> gr.gui_edit(root)
</pre>
<p>To <em>select</em> a node or edge click the mouse's left button
while the cursor is over the object. To draw an edge to a selected
node place the cursor above another node and click the right
button. Clicking the left button when over empty space provides the
opportunity to add a vertex. (Just hit the generated "OK" button, if
you do this by mistake.)  Draw yourself some graph and click "Done"
when finished.</p>
<p> Work out the clique hypergraph of your graph and check your answer
      by doing</p>
<pre>
>>> print gr.hypergraph()
</pre>
<p>
We haven't covered an algorithm for pulling out cliques, but if your
    graphs are not too big you should be able to do it 'by
    eye'. Repeat this exercise for a few graphs that you create.</p>

<hr />

<h4><a id="factors"></a>Factor algebra</h4>

    <p>
      OK, this is a rather tedious exercise, but since factor
      multiplication and marginalisation are so central you have to do
      it by hand at least once. Firstly, for multiplication do the
      following:
    </p>
<pre>
>>> from gPy.Examples import asia
>>> f1 =  asia['Bronchitis'] * asia['Cancer']
>>> f2 = asia['Bronchitis'] * 1
>>> print f1
>>> print f2
</pre>
    <p>
      Now compute the product of <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code>
      by hand. (OK, you can use a calculator to do the
      multiplications.) Check your answer with:</p>
<pre>
>>> from gPy.Demos import *
>>> prod_gui(f1,f2)
</pre>
    <p>
      Now for marginalisation. Do:</p>
    <pre>
>>> f = f1*f2
>>> marginalise_gui(f)
</pre>
    <p>
      Compute by hand the factor which results from marginalising away
      the variable <code>Cancer</code>. Check your answer by selecting
      the <code>Cancer</code> variable by clicking it with the left
      mouse button and then 'pressing' the <code>Sum out
	selected</code> button.</p>
<hr />

<h4><a id="ci"></a>Conditional independence</h4>

    <p>
      Grab a graph to play with and display it:</p>
<pre>
>>> from gPy.Examples import asia
>>> gr = asia.adg().moralise()
>>> from Tkinter import Tk
>>> gr.gui_display(Tk())
</pre>
    <p>
      Let <i>P</i> be some probability distribution which factorises
      according to this graph. Work out which of the following
      (conditional) independence statements must be true about P.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	VisitAsia is independent of Bronchitis conditional on
	Tuberculosis
      </li>
      <li>
	VisitAsia is independent of Bronchitis
      </li>
      <li>
	Dyspnea is independent of Smoking conditional on TbOrCa and Bronchitis
      </li>
      <li>
	Dyspnea is independent of Smoking conditional on Bronchitis
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Check your answers using <a
	href="../../gPy/Doc/API/gPy.Hypergraphs.Incidence-class.html#reachable">reachable</a> or <a href="../../gPy/Doc/API/gPy.Hypergraphs.Incidence-class.html#separates">separates</a>
      </p>

<hr />

<h4><a id="cc"></a>Looking for loops</h4>

    <p>
      This question is harder than the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      A loop (or cycle) is a path in an undirected graph from a vertex
      back to itself. Write a Python module defining a class MyUGraph
      which extends gPy's UGraph with one extra method which checks to
      see if a given vertex is part of a cycle. Naturally you will
      need to check the gPy API documentation to see which methods are
      available from UGraph, the neighbours method will definitely be
      useful. I haven't yet written a solution, but I'm pretty sure
      Python's set builtin type will come in useful. Your module will
      look like this:
    </p>

    <pre>    
from gPy.Graphs import UGraph

class MyUGraph(UGraph):

    def in_loop(self,vertex):
      .....
    </pre>
