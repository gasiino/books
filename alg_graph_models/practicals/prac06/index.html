    <h4><a id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h4>

    <p>
      This practical asks you to work through a couple of examples
      using the WinBUGS tool. To use this tool you should be running
      Windows, so if you aren't reboot now!</p>
    <p>
      The WinBUGS stuff is in <tt>C:\Program Files\WinBUGS14. </tt>You
      can start WinBUGS by running the following: <tt>C:\Program
      Files\WinBUGS14\WinBUGS14.exe</tt>
    </p>

    <h4>
    <a id="asia"></a>The Asia expert system
    </h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
	Start up WinBUGS by running <tt>C:\Program
	Files\WinBUGS14\WinBUGS14.exe</tt>
      </li>
      <li>
	Once WinBUGS has started, use the <tt>Open </tt>command from
	the <tt>File </tt>menu to open the file <tt>C:\Program
	Files\WinBUGS14\Examples\Asia.odc</tt>.  This contains the
	fictitious "Asia" medical expert system, which was previously
	discussed in the lectures.
      </li>
      <li>
	Note that the Asia example contains a number of parts:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The model: a description of the Asia Bayesian net in the
	    BUGS language.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The data: in this case the data just gives the conditional
	    and unconditional probabilities needed to define the
	    Bayesian net.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Initial values: BUGS uses simulation (<i>Markov Chain
	    Monte Carlo)</i> to do its computations. Here someone has
	    manually put in some initial values for the nodes of the
	    net. (BUGS can usually work out reasonable initial values
	    if they are not put in by the user).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Results: Here are some results from a previous run. You
	    are going to create some new results.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
      <li>
	Bring up the <tt>Specification tool </tt>by selecting
	Specification... from the Model drop-down menu,
      </li>
      <li>
	Select <tt>check_model</tt> from the <tt>Specification
	tool</tt>.  This checks there are no syntax errors in the
	model description. You should get a <tt>model is syntactically
	correct</tt> mesage at the bottom of your screen.
      </li>
      <li>
	Double click on the word <tt>list </tt>just under the
	<tt>Data</tt> heading.  Now select <tt>load data </tt>from
	the <tt>Specification tool </tt>menu.  This loads the data.
      </li>
      <li>
	Now select <tt>compile </tt>from the <tt>Specification
	Tool</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Double click on the word <tt>list </tt>just under the
	<tt>Inits</tt> heading.  Now select <tt>load inits
	</tt>from the <tt>Specification Tool </tt>menu.
      </li>
      <li>
	Now you are ready to do computation by simulation. Select
	<tt>Update...  </tt>from the <tt>Model </tt>menu. A window
	will appear. Don't bother changing the default values you get,
	just click the <tt>update </tt>button to do 1000
	iterations. This means 1000 guessed values for each node are
	generated.  So far you are not acutally recording any of these
	1000 guessed values for each node. We are just running the
	chain in order to "forget" the initial values. No need to kill
	the window.
      </li>
      <li>
	Now select <tt>Samples... </tt>from the Inference menu. Type
	<tt>smoking </tt>in the node window, and then click
	<tt>set</tt>. From now on guessed values for <tt>smoking
	</tt>will be recorded. Do the same for
	<tt>lung.cancer</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Go back to the update window, and click update again, to
	perform another 1000 iterations.
      </li>
      <li>
	Now we will have a look at the values that have been produced
	by the simulation you have just run. Select
	<tt>Samples...</tt> again from the <tt>Inference </tt>window
	to get the <tt>Sample Monitor Tool </tt>window back (no need
	to do this, if the window is still there!). Make sure
	<tt>lung.cancer</tt> appears in the node window, by using the
	little arrow on the right of the node box, if necessary. Click
	on <tt>density </tt>to get a histogram of the values which
	have been generated for <tt>lung.cancer</tt>. A value of "1"
	indicates "no", and "2" indicates "yes". Leave the window open
	and do another 1000 updates as before.
      </li>
      <li>
	With <tt>lung.cancer</tt> in the node window, click on
	<tt>density </tt>again.  The histogram won't have changed due
	to the last 1000 updates, so we have converged on the correct
	values for P(<tt>lung.cancer</tt>=yes) and
	P(<tt>lung.cancer</tt>=no).  Have a look at the histogram for
	smoking too.
      </li>
      <li>
	Also click on <tt>trace </tt>in the <tt>Sample Monitor
	Tool. </tt>with <tt>lung.cancer </tt>in the node window. This
	shows the values of <tt>lung.cancer</tt> on each
	iteration. (It is usually "1" which means "no")
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a id="beetles"></a>Beetles</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
	This example uses a Bayesian net to analyse data on how many
	beetles are killed after 5 hour exposure to carbon
	disulphide.
      </li>
      <li>
	Open up <tt>C:\Program Files\WinBUGS14\Examples\Beetles.odc
	</tt>from WinBUGS
      </li>
      <li>
	Now proceed as for the Asia example, this time keeping track
	of the node <tt>alpha.</tt> Note how the graph produced by the
	density button gets smoother as you do more iterations. This
	is because we are converging to the true probability
	distribution for this parameter.
      </li>
      <li>
	Note that <tt>alpha </tt>can have infinitely many values, it
	is a continuous random variable. Most real applications of
	Bayesian nets focus on continuous valued random
	variables.
      </li>
    </ol>
