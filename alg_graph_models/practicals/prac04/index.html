    <h4><a id="check_redund"></a>Checking for redundancy</h4>

    <p>A hyperedge in a hypergraph is redundant if it is contained
      within another hyperedge. A hypergraph is <dfn>reduced</dfn> if
      it contains no redundant hyperedges.</p>

    <p>In this question, your job is to complete <a
    href="red_hg_incomplete.py">this Python program</a> which checks
    for redundancy in hypergraphs, so that it produces <a
    href="output.txt">this output</a> when run like this: <kbd>python
    red_hg.py hg_exs.txt</kbd>. The file <a
    href="hg_exs.txt">hgs_exs.txt</a> is available. Do not use
      gPy. You're allowed to go for something simple and sub-optimal;
      the solution below is like this. (It's much quicker to check for
    redundancy (and much else) if one maintains a <em>dual</em>
      representation of a hypergraph, but this is rather complicated
      for now.)</p>

    <h4><a id="classify_hypergraphs"></a>Classifying hypergraphs</h4>

    <p>
      Recall that each hypergraph H has an associated graph: its
      2-section H<sub>2</sub>. Two vertices in H<sub>2</sub> are
      connected if they both occur in some hyperedge of H. The cliques
      of H<sub>2</sub> make a hypergraph. Sometimes this hypergraph is
      H and sometimes not.
    </p>

    <p> For example, if H = {{A,B,C},{A,C,D}}, then H<sub>2</sub> has
    the following connections: A-B,A-C,B-C,A-D,C-D. The cliques of
    H<sub>2</sub> are then {A,B,C} and {A,C,D}, exactly the hyperedges of
    H. In contrast, consider the hypergraph H' =
    {{A,B},{B,C},{A,C}}.  H'<sub>2</sub> has connections A-B, B-C, A-C, so
    H'<sub>2</sub> has just one clique: {A,B,C}. The hypergraph H is said
    to be <dfn>graphical</dfn> whereas H' is not. Now here's the
    proper definition of a graphical hypergraph.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	A hypergraph H is <dfn>graphical</dfn> if each clique of H<sub>2</sub>
	is contained within some hyperedge in H. In this case, the
	clique hypergraph of H<sub>2</sub> is exactly red(H), where red(H) is
	the reduced version of H produced by deleting redundant
	hyperedges.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    
    <p>
      Use gPy to write a program which decides whether hypergraphs are
      graphical or not. Your program should read in hypergraphs in the
      format of <a href="hg_exs.txt">hgs_exs.txt</a>. Do not use gPy's
      <code>is_graphical</code> method (which needs improving anyway),
      but use anything else you find useful. You will need to look at
      the <a href="../../gPy/Doc/API/">gPy API documentation</a> to
      find useful stuff.

    <h4><a id="ci"></a>Conditional independence in BNs</h4>    
    
    <p>Now you should be able to have a go at the last question of <a
	href="../prac03">Practical 03</a>, so do it.

    <h4><a id="triangulation"></a>Triangulation</h4>

    <p>Look at <a
    href="../../gPy/Doc/API/gPy.Graphs.UGraph-class.html#triangulate2">the
    description of the simpler of gPy's two triangulation methods</a> for undirected
    graphs. Without peeking at my source write the appropriate Python
    code. Give your method a different name, so that when you are
    testing you can be sure that it is your code that is being
    used. Of course, have a look once you're happy with your own
    solution. Feel free to use any other gPy methods.
    </p>

    <p>Pages 106-107 of <a
	href="../../agm.pdf"><cite>Algorithms for Graphical
	  Models</cite></a> discuss the drawbacks of using the simple
      triangulation method used here and describe a superior
      approach.
