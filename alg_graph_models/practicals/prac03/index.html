    <h4><a id="netica"></a>Getting started with Netica</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of this question is to introduce you to Netica, the
      Bayes net software you will use for some questions in this practical.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Reboot to Windows XP, if necessary
      </li>
      <li>
	Start up Netica, it's at: g:\apps\Netica\Netica
	1.12\Netica.exe
      </li>
      <li>
	Find the on-line help (yes, it's under the Help menu
	item).Netica is not terribly good at finding the file
	containing the on-line help.  If it can't find it, it will ask
	you to look for it. The file in question is called Netica.hlp
	in g:\apps\Netica\Netica 1.12\
      </li> 
      <li>
	Under Getting Started, select the Quick Tour
      </li> 
      <li>
	Please ignore anything you come across about Decision nodes.
	Decision theory is not part of this module.
      </li>
      <li>
	Go through the first 4 parts of the Quick Tour, ie up to and
	including Network Construction
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h4><a id="redgreen"></a>The red and the green</h4>
    <p>
      Model the card trick with the red and green sided cards using a
      Bayesian net. Use Netica. Use your Bayesian net to compute the
      probability distribution over the possible identities of the
      selected card conditional on the colour you are shown.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="evidence"></a>Thinking about evidence</h4>
    <p>
      A doctor wishes to test one of his/her patients for Blogg's
      disease which afflicts one person in every 1000. There is a
      well-developed test for the occurrence of Blogg's disease, so
      that
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	if an individual has Blogg's disease the probability of a positive test
	result is 0.95
      </li>
      <li>
	if an individual does not have Blogg's the probability of a
	positive test result is 0.01
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The patient gets a positive test result. How likely is it that
      he/she has Blogg's disease?
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4><a id="prizes"></a>Winning prizes</h4>
    <p>
      We haven't "covered" this sort of topic in the module - this is
      just a test of your probabilistic intuition. There's a game show
      in the US where a prize is hidden behind one of three
      curtains. Firstly, the contestant chooses one of these curtains.
      Let's call this curtain A. At this point, at least one of the
      other curtains, let's call them B and C, does not have a prize
      behind it. The host then selects one curtain other than the one
      chosen, and shows the contestant that there is no prize behind
      it. If the host has a choice of curtains he chooses one at
      random. Suppose B were the chosen curtain. The contestant can
      now either stick with their initial guess (A) or switch to the
      remaining curtain (C). Which should they do to maximise their
      probability of winning the prize? What are the probabilities of
      winning the prize with the two strategies?
    </p>

    <h4><a id="joints"></a>Joint distributions
      and Bayes nets</h4>

    <p>
      Rewrite P(A,B,C,D,E,F) using the conditional independencies
      expressed by the following Bayesian net, which we will refer to
      as NET1 in subsequent questions:
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that all the random variables A-F in NET1 can only have
      two possible values yes and no. What's the minimum number of
      probabilities required to fully define the Bayesian net whose
      structure is given above?  (Remember that eg P(E=yes) = 1 -
      P(E=no).
    </p>


    <p>
      How many probabilities would be required to define the full
      joint distribution over A-F, if we could not assume the
      conditional independencies expressed by the Bayesian net NET1?
    </p>

    <h4><a id="ci"></a>Conditional independence in Bayesian nets</h4>

    <p>
      All these questions refer to the above network NET1. 
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	Is C independent of F conditional on D? 
      </li>
      <li>
	Is C independent of F conditional on D and E? 
      </li>
      <li>
	Write down all pairs of nodes which are independent of each other.
      </li>
      <li>
	Which pairs of nodes are independent of each other given B? 
      </li>
      <li>
	Do we have that: P(A,F|E)= P(A|E)P(F|E)? (ie are A and F
	independent given E?)
      </li>
    </ol>
