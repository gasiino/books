      <li>
	The smallest ancestral graph including C, F and D also
	includes A and B, ie it's like NET1 with E (and all arrows
	going to E) deleted. No parents need to be married to make the
	moral graph, so we just drop directions to get the interaction
	graph. There is no path from F to any variable, so it's
	indpendent of anything conditional on anything. So clearly
	it's independent of C conditional on D.
      </li>
      <li>
      The smallest ancestral graph including C, F, D and E is the
	whole of NET1. Moralising add links between the 3 parents of E
	(namely B, D and F). This gives us a path C-B-F. This path
	contains neither D nor E, so we conclude that C is NOT
	independent of F given D <em>and</em> E.
      </li>
      <li>
	This is a bit of a plod. For each pair, find the smallest
	ancestral graph containing that pair. Moralise this ancestral
	graph, and see if you can find <em>any</em> path between the
	pair. If there is none then they are independent, otherwise,
	in general, they won't be. Since A is an ancestor of B, C, D
	and E, it's clear that the smallest ancestral graph for any
	pair of these will include A, and thus even without adding any
	lines due to moralisation there will be a path between the
	pair. So each such pair is not independent. E and F are not
	independent clearly. Finally, consider the pairs AF, BF, CD,
	DF. In each case the smallest ancestral graph does not include
	E, hence F gets disconnected, so it's independent of all of A,
	B, C and D.
      </li> 
      <li>
	Just form smallest ancestral graphs, moralise them and check
	to see if there is a path avioding B. You will find that AF,
	AC, CD, CE, CF, DF are all the pairs of independent variables.
      </li>
      <li>
	A and F are not independent given E. Since E is involved the
	smallest ancestral graph is like NET1 but with C
	gone. Moralisation makes links between the parents of E. So in
	the interaction graph, we have the path A-D-F showing that we
	cannot conclude that A and F are independent given E.
